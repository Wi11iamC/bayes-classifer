# KNN Implementation

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a popular supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The basic idea behind KNN is to classify or predict the class of a new observation by finding the K nearest data points in the training set, based on a distance metric, and assigning the class based on the majority class among those K nearest neighbors.

In other words, given a new data point, KNN finds the K data points in the training set that are closest to the new data point in terms of a distance metric (such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance). It then assigns the class of the new data point based on the majority class among those K nearest neighbors.

### It includes the following directories and files:
- `main.py`: This is the main file of the project that can be run to execute the program.
- `results/`: This directory contains the data collected about the Naive Bayes model, such as training time, accuracy vs percentages, etc.
- `data/`: This directory contains the training, validation, and test data required for running the program.
- `data.zip`: This is the compressed version of the data/ directory.
